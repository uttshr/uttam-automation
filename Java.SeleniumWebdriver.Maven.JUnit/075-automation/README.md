Maven is a build tool (build manager, in fact), similar to ANT. The main job of any build tool is configure the project, compile using required projects and do the final packaging. A build script in your project gives a blue-print of project's deliverable structure

If the Maven is not installed while installing eclipse then we will have to manually install it from https://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/latest/ 
As we already have maven we can skip this but if you dont have maven then open eclipse. Click Help > Install new software > Add and then give name Maven and paste that URL
